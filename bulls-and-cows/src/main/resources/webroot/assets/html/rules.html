				Bulls and cows is a logical game for guessing numbers, also known as Mastermind, 4digits or 1A2B. Your goal is to guess your opponent's secret number with a minimum number of suggestions.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can either play against the computer or your friend.
			</p>
			<p>
				On each move the player tries to guess his/her opponent number. The opponent responds by announcing the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls", if they are on different positions, they are "cows". The first person to reveal their opponent's secret number wins the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				NOTE: Digits in the number can't be duplicated or contain 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example:
			</p>
			<p>Secret number: 8561</p>
			<p>Opponent's try: 3518</p>

			<p>Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "5", the cows are "8" and "1".)</p>

				During the game you can use hints. When you use a hint, the game automatically adds the digit in the selected cell. If the entered number already contains this digit, it is removed from its current position and placed on the correct one.
			</p>
			<p>
				When hint is used, the hinted digits will stay on their corresponding cells after each guess, unless you delete them.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you play with 3 or 4 digits in number you can use hint no more than one time in one game. If you play with a number that contains 5 or 6 digits you can use hint only 2 times in a game.

				Draft

				You can use the draft to mark digits that you think are included or not in your opponent secret number.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on a digit to mark it as excluded. Double click on a digit to mark it as included. To clear the digit, tap it again.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you mark a digit as excluded, the excluded digit will be disabled on the keyboard. You can change this in settings: Disable numbers.
